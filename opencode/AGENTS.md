In all interactions, be extremely (!!!) concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision

## Planning

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
Make the questions extremely concise.

## External Reference Repositories

You have read access to local reference repositories located at `.reference/*`. 
When I ask for examples or patterns not found in this project, search there first.

Currently available:
- `jazz`, a local first synced database
- `tilly`, a PWA built with jazz and the AI SDK optimized for mobile
- `alkalye`, a offline capable PWA built with jazz

## Quality

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes
someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt
that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners
you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. **Leave the codebase better than you found it.**
